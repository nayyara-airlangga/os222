## Week 01

1. [The OS Dev Wiki] <br>
This is a pretty good link if you're looking to build an operating systems from scratch. The pages here have a pretty hands-on way of explaining certain topics. It is also a good link if you're looking to truly dive deep into operating systems as it covers many aspects of an operating systems and various architectures in great detail. Overall, a great general reference for this course in my opinion.

## Week 02

1. [Makefile Tutorial] <br>
Makefiles are commonly used build tooling. It is used to manage and decide parts of a program to be built/compiled. This tutorial provides a pretty good base for understanding how Makefiles work and the many things we can do with Makefiles. 

2. [The GNU Privacy Handbook] <br>
GnuPG is a tool used for digital encryption that provides a way to do secure communication based on the OpenPGP standard. This handbook provides a comprehensive explanation on the concepts behind GnuPG, various encryption methods, and how to use GnuPG. It also provides good examples so that we can follow along. This helped me gain a more solid base on GnuPG's aims and design.

3. [Man in the Middle (MITM) Attack] <br>
MITM attacks are one of the many ways malicious actor can violate security policies and gain access to resources and data illegitimately. This is a great article that explains how MITM attacks are typically done, key concepts, examples, and several mitigation techniques on dealing with MITM. This helped me gain the fundamentals and overview of MITM attacks.
